Electricity is crucial in everyday life, used in various settings for its ease of control. It involves understanding the flow of electric current, which travels through a conductor in a closed path called an electric circuit. A typical circuit includes a cell (power source), wires (conductors), a switch (controller), and a load (device). When the circuit is closed, current flows to a bulb and lights it up; when broken, the bulb goes out. Initially thought to be the flow of positive charges, current is now understood as the flow of electrons, with its direction considered opposite to electron flow. The next video will explain how to express electric current.
